**Recruitment management system** designed to simplify the hiring process while complying with the Saudi Personal Data
Protection Law (PDPL). This platform ensures that you won't encounter irrelevant questions or unnecessary data
collection during the application process—**you don't even need to provide your name**. This approach promotes **equal
treatment** for all applicants, as any additional information can be gathered after a job offer is made.

With efficient role-based interactions, users can easily manage job postings, review applications, and apply for jobs.
The system features a secure backend with AI-driven analytics to enhance decision-making.

Prioritizing **efficiency** and **user experience**, this platform offers a straightforward solution for recruitment
challenges, free from clutter and focused on what truly matters.

## Q&A

**Q:** What does `Jidhom` mean?

- It is an Arabic word `جِدْهُم`, means `find them`.

**Q:** Why did you work on such project?

1. To further familiarize myself with Rust web development, async programming, and databases.
2. Most recruitment systems are plagued with bugs, have numerous edge cases, and collect irrelevant data. So I wanted to
   create an effective and privacy respecting example.
